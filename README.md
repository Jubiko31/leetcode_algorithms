## Description

Welcome to my LeetCode solutions repository. LeetCode provides an array of coding challenges designed to evaluate your technical skills and improve your problem-solving capabilities. This repository serves as a documentation of my journey through these challenges. Here, you'll find a collection of solutions that offer insights into my approach, coding methods, and innovative problem-solving strategies.


## About This Repository

‚ö° **Diverse Language Support:** This repository showcases solutions written in a variety of programming languages. Whether you're familiar with one language or many, you'll find solutions that cater to your preferences.

üìö **Structured Approach:** Each problem solution is organized in its own directory, making it easy to locate and understand. The directory contains the problem statement, the solution code, and **runtime** and **memory**

üåå **Continuous Learning:** The repository reflects my ongoing journey to learn and improve. As I tackle new LeetCode challenges, project is in progress and will be always. Feel free to contribute or provide feedback, improvement in any aspect of repo.


## About Me

I'm Backend Engineer and Cybersecurity Specialist. Working with many different languages/technologies like Python, Rust, Node.js, C, etc. You can view my porfolio website for more info.


## Repository Structure

- Each programming language has its directory.
- Inside each directory there is different categories, like `Leetcode`, `Cyphers`, etc.
- `Leetcode` is dived into three categories - Easy, Medium, Hard.
- Inside each folder, you'll find solved problems with problem statement, solution code.
- The solutions also include how many percent of leetcode codes' Runtime and Memory it beats.
